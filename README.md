# task1-database-schema
## 📌 Objective
To design and implement a relational database schema using SQL and visualize it through an ER (Entity-Relationship) diagram.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench

## 📁 Files Included
- `library_schema.sql` – SQL script containing the table creation code for Users, Books, and Loans.
- - `Library_ER_Diagram.png` – ER diagram image showing the relationship between the tables.

## 🗂️ Description
In this task, I created a database schema for a simple **Library Management System** with the following structure:

- `Users` table: stores user details.
- `Books` table: stores book details.
- `Loans` table: connects users and books through borrow/return actions.

I used SQL in MySQL Workbench to create the tables and define relationships using primary and foreign keys. The ER diagram was generated through the modeling tool in MySQL Workbench.

## ✅ Outcome
- A working SQL schema for a library system
- A clearly structured ER diagram showing table relationships
